# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a graphical tool that helps users understand and visualize the workings of different sorting algorithms. Currently, the visualizer supports four sorting algorithms: **Insertion Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Merge Sort**. The tool is built using Python and Pygame, and it generates random numbers, sorts them, and visualizes the sorting process in the form of bar graphs.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with dynamic graphical visualizations.
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **User Input**: Enter the number of elements you want to sort and the speed at which the sorting should be visualized.
- **Random Array Generation**: Elements are randomly generated and pushed into an array for sorting.
- **Customizable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting process for better visualization.

## Installation

To run the Algorithm Visualizer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Hap1dev/algorithm-analyzer.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

4. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python3 algoanalyzer.py

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted in the terminal to enter:

- **Number of elements**: This will be the number of randomly generated elements (bars) that will be sorted.
- **Speed of Sorting**: Enter the desired speed for the visualization (e.g., 1 for fast, 10 for slow).

Once you provide the inputs, the sorting visualization will begin using the selected algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pygame**

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
- Allow users to input their own arrays for sorting.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to select algorithms and set parameters.
- Optimize performance for handling larger datasets.
